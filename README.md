# Exam-unit-2
Sorry that I do not have commits for these assignments. I went back to the Netherlands this week so I could visit my terminally ill grandpa for, most likely, the last time and I forgot to take my laptop with me. This made it so I had to do all the coding on our pc at home, which required a code to download things like node and github desktop and we did not find this code unfortunately. I solved this by testing all my code manually on a site called RunJS and I uploaded my files manually to github too (which is why I have no commits).

Just to clarify, this is not some kind of excuse. I simply wanted you to know why I do not have commits this time.
